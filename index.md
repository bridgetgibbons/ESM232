## ESM 232 &ndash; Spring 2020 

## Overview


Computer-based modeling and simulation are widely used tools in both practical environmental problem solving and in environmental research. Models give us a way to look at the world through a mixture of data and theory. A good model can help us to understand how the world works and how decisions that we make might change the world in ways that are important to us. There are many different types of models, from simple to complex, and models are often tailored to answer a specific questions. This course will give you skills that help you to choose which model, or modeling technique, is right for you - given the task at hand. The course will cover both designing a new model and evaluating existing models. We will emphasize best practices that help to design models that are useful, reliable and get the job done. This is a skills based course and we will use R (a data analysis and programming environment) as our basic platform. Topics to be covered are listed below (this is a tentative list - we may change it as the course progresses to adapt to class interest/abilities).Class will include a mix of lectures and hands-on examples, using students' own computers. 


There are 10 assignments and a project. Some assignments will be individual, others will be done in pairs. Assignments will vary in length, most will be short coding assignments with a 1- paragraph write up. For the project, you will work in small groups to develop a multi-component model on a topic of your choosing.
